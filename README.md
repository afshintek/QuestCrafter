# QuestCrafter
Gamify real life with quests (challenging friedns)— built with ASP.NET Core Web API

This is a little project I'm building for fun and practice (no fun actually, just practice).

I got the idea from an AI-chat bot and it sounded challenging and kindda cool, and a good way to learn more about ASP.NET Core Web API and Entity Framework Core and etc.

## 🎯 What's the idea?

**QuestCrafter** is basically a real-life quest planner.  
The idea is simple:

- Create small, real-life "quests" (like *Try a weird food*, *Visit a new place*, *Learn a dance move*)
- Break them down into steps
- Set deadlines
- Invite friends to join in
- Everyone tracks their progress, and there's a fun leaderboard

Not a game, not a fitness app — just something to make everyday life a little more adventurous.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack (so far)

- **ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 8)**
- **Entity Framework Core** (code-first, with complex relationships)
- **SQL Server** (or SQLite for testing)

I haven’t picked a frontend yet — maybe React, Blazor, or something else.  
For now, it’s backend-only and all about clean API design.

## 💡 Why I'm building it

I wanted something that:
- Forces me to use real-world Entity Framework Core relationships (like Quests, Steps, Players)
- Gives me practice with clean API structure
- Includes stuff like user roles, invitations, tracking progress, and some fun logic
- Could one day be a full-stack app
